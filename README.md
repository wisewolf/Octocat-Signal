# Octocat Signal

## Introduction

Constant notifications are hell. We are building a fun and calmer notification system for Github based on colored lights .

## Description

If you work with Github you wonder, "are there any issues pending?", "Did johnny send that pull request already?"

Octocat signal aims to deal away with the stress, or at least make it bearable. We will use a led system that lights up an  octocat figurine with different colors.

This will be done with an **ESP8266 (NodeMCU)** running [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/), with the goal of being completly standalone.

The initial version of the Octosignal will be made for Github users. Other versions can be made for other sources of notifications.

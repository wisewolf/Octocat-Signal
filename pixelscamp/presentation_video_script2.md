> Hello, who are you?

Hello Humans, I am the Octocat and I am here to tell you about Project 23, **The Octocat Signal**!

> And you're doing this project all alone?

No silly. My team is Bruno, João, Miguel and Nuno. A crazy group of lobsters that have known each other for a long time.

> But, what will your project do ? 

With the octocat signal we will help you keep calm, displaying gentle notifications on how your github projects are going.

For example, New Issues can be Red, pending Pull requests Yellow and Green when there are no issues.

> You must have been doing this for a long time …

Don't be a silly human. We started this on day 1 of Pixel Camp. We will use an ESP8266 and MicroPython.

We are printing some parts with the guys from Bee Very Creative, programming the LED lights, and the web interface so that you can configure your GitHub login.

> Wow, and when will it be ready?

Soon we will have a finished prototype to showcase to you on the GitHub stand. So see you soon humans!

Hello Humans, I am the Octocat and I am here to tell you about Project 23, **The Octocat Signal**!

This is my team: Bruno, Jo√£o, Miguel and Nuno. 

A crazy group of lobsters that know each other for a long time.

With the octocat signal we will help you keep calm, displaying gentle notifications on how your github projects are going.

- New Issues (Red)
- Pull requests pending (Yellow)
- Build passing (Green)

We started this on day 1 of Pixel Camp, exploring ways to do it. We will use an ESP8266 and MicroPython because I like tiny snakes.

So far we have done _____________

Soon we will have a finished prototype to showcase to you on the GitHub stand. 

See you soon humans!
